 /**

 *
 * @brief Worker thread functions.
 * @file io/worker.c
 *
 *  The "worker" thread is the one responsible for the bulk of the
 *  work done when processing a request.  Workers are spawned by the
 *  scheduler, and create a kqueue (KQ) and control-plane
 *  Atomic Queue (AQ) for control-plane communication.
 *
 *  When a network thread discovers that it needs more workers, it
 *  asks the scheduler for a KQ/AQ combination.  The network thread
 *  then creates a channel dedicated to that worker, and sends the
 *  channel to the worker in a "new channel" message.  The worker
 *  receives the channel, and sends an ACK back to the network thread.
 *
 *  The network thread then sends the worker new packets, which the
 *  worker receives and processes.
 *
 *  The lifecycle of a packet MUST be carefully managed.  Initially,
 *  messages are put into the "to_decode" heap.  If the messages sit
 *  in the heap for too long, they are localized and put into the
 *  "localized" heap.  Each heap is ordered by (priority, time), so
 *  that high priority packets take precedence over low priority
 *  packets.
 *
 *  Both queues have linked lists of received packets, ordered by
 *  time.  This list is used to clean up packets which have been in
 *  the heap for "too long", in fr_worker_check_timeouts().
 *
 *  When a packet is decoded, it is put into the "runnable" heap, and
 *  also into the head of the "time_order" linked list. The main loop
 *  fr_worker() then pulls requests off of this heap and runs them.
 *  The fr_worker_check_timeouts() function also checks the tail of
 *  the "time_order" list, and ages out requests which have been
 *  running for "too long".
 *
 *  A request may return one of FR_IO_YIELD,
 *  FR_IO_REPLY, or FR_IO_DONE.  If a request is
 *  yeilded, it is placed onto the yielded list in the worker
 *  "tracking" data structure.
